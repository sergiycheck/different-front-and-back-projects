# Homework

Here I made a simple example of movie DB API request. From here i want you to extend this application.
What would i like you to do:
- Add a few routes (home page, about page, movies list for example) and the home page will have list of selected movies, movies page - all movies, about page - info about app. You not restricted to use those tabs, you may create any tabs you like, just make sure you have some routing.
- Add header with a list of a tabs so you can navigate with it
- Add some form (either to filter or to add some items, it could be movies or user data form with favorite movie genrÑƒ for example), you can use any forms you like (reactive or template-driven).
- Use pipe(s), for example currency pipe to show movie budget value with some currency, additionaly you can use directives to implement the hover effect for example
- Make correct components structure (don't place whole form and list and list items in one home component, split those into home, home-list, home-list-item components)
- Using interfaces and typescript types would be a plus
Feel free to add any functionality you want, just experiment with Angular features you have learnt.

Refernce to API documentation: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
To get your own API key, you need to simply authorize on https://www.themoviedb.org/ and then go to settings -> API tab and generate you api_key

NOTE!: If you have some issues with given API you are free to use any API you like or don't use API at all. But it would be great if you add some asynchronous logit, just to show that you can work with rxjs and http module.

Good luck & have fun
